        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            In universities with 50+ affiliated colleges sharing a common curriculum, many colleges lack the infrastructure to provide students with adequate study material. As a result, students must independently collect, compile, and distribute notes within their circle. Often, after exams, these notes are discarded or passed along informally, never reaching a centralized platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            This fragmented and inefficient process wastes significant amounts of time, energy, money, and even paper (through excessive photocopying).
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, <strong>Online Note Gallery</strong> was born—a platform to eliminate this repetitive cycle by creating a centralized, open-access library for sharing study materials.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Online Note Gallery </strong> is an open and free-for-all platform where students can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upload their study material effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Download study resources shared by others.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with peers and create a collective knowledge pool.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Teachers can also actively contribute by sharing their resources, notes, and guidelines, further enhancing the platform's value.</p>
        
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
            Even though <strong>Online Note Gallery</strong> is an open platform, its quality is safeguarded by a moderation layer. Every contribution by a student passes through <strong>Online Note Gallery admins </strong> who review, accept, or reject submissions based on relevance and quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once approved, the content becomes publicly accessible, ensuring that only useful, high-quality material is added to the library.
